# EXPLOITS
## 1. "Sync Internals Password Extractor" (SIPE)
### Discovered by SimonTheCat#0651
This method will help you find your saved WiFi passwords on a ChromeOS device, which you typically cannot view. Unless you are an update blocker, this will not work on devices added by your school/work.

To use this method, go to the website listed below, type in the __EXACT__ name of the WiFi network into the text box, then press "the magic button". Then, head to "chrome://sync-internals", press the tab on the top that says "Search", and type "wifi". Once you do this, look for the HEX numbers and letters that the website generated for you ending with "<||>psk" inside of that list, click on it, and inside of that file you clicked on, copy all of the data, head back to the website and replace the name of your WiFi network in the input box with all of the data you just copied from that file, then press "the magic buton" again.
